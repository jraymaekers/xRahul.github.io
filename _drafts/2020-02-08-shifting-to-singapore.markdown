If you're a working professional, there's a chance that your next job might not be from the same city. Having lived in a different Indian city every few years for the last decade or so, I am somewhat used to the move now. But from my Singapore experience, shifting to another country is pretty different! There's the things you will expect like language and cultural differences, but there are also different laws, unwritten rules, finance and tax situation and most importantly the tips and tricks to everyday things that you've always taken for granted in your home country.

This article will highlight what I consider to be the "must-know" if you're planning to shift & live in Singapore long term. Let me start with a simple timeline!


## Timeline

This is the moment you've accepted the job offer and have started researching(hopefully) what to expect and what will happen now. I'll be assuming you're also shifting for work because this will be more relevant for you that way. Anyways, here's a relevant timeline from my perspective-
1. Your company will ask you fill up the form for visa and apply for a **[work permit](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/apply-for-work-permit)** on your behalf to **[MOM(Ministry of Manpower)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/)**.
2. If your application is approved, you'll get an **[IPA](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/sector-specific-rules/in-principle-approval)** letter in about a week. This allows a one-time entry to Singapore where you'll do the further process to get the Work Pass.
3. Wait until you get your IPA to start anything related to shifting. Do not even book your flight tickets before that as your visa isn't confirmed yet. This is the moment you need to start getting serious about the move and **research**-
   1. Go through the official **[MOM](https://www.mom.gov.sg/)** website. It is a treasure trove of information and really, what's better than the official government source? Start with the **[Work passes and permits](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits)**
   2. Start looking for a **[valid residential address](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing)**. It's _required_ to have a residential address before you can start working in the company. I'll add the details below on why.
4. Now skipping to your arrival at the Singapore airport- *Keep a Pen handy!*
5. After you reach Singapore, you'll be given a small pink form to fill. This is the **[immigration form](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteringanddeparting/disembarkation-embarkation-card)**. You'll NEED to keep it on you until you get your employment pass, so fill it correctly and keep it safe.
6. You can be taken aside and asked to wait in a *waiting room* at immigration if it's your first time in Singapore. This is routine and happened to me only the first time. After some beureaucracy, you'll finally enter Singapore.
7. _Arrive a few days before_ you'll be starting work. This will give you time to check out the residential places you've narrowed down and shift. Have some cash on hand for the initial deposit and rent as you won't have a local bank account at that time.
8. Get a local number as soon as possible. The HR will need a local residential address and phone number for the next step of the visa process- **[Notification Letter](https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/can-i-start-work-if-i-havent-received-my-work-pass-card-but-have-my-notification-letter)**. This is *required* before your first day at work.
9. Not that you've been localised enough, time to start work and finally get the Work Pass. Your company will discuss with you and set an **appointment** with MOM for the next and final step- taking your **photo and biometrics** for the Pass (**[Ref](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/apply-for-a-pass#register-fingerprints-and-photo)**). You'll get your pass mailed in about a week after that.
10. After you get your pass, you can finally *apply for the bank account*. For me, I applied for [DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg) and it's a simple online process for them. Not sure about the others, but di a little research and apply wherever you want.


## Renting guide

Housing and renting situation is far more complicated in Singapore than I expected coming from India. Most of the locals here also don't know the exact laws and rules as many of them were amended recently. I'e highlighted the important things below, but in this case, the more you research and know, the better. This can also change anytime, so do a fact-check before you move ahead with anything.

Go through some articles if you're up for it. Start with-
* *[Internations -Housing in Singapore](https://www.internations.org/go/moving-to-singapore/housing)*
* *[Moneysmart - Short Term Rental in Singapore](https://blog.moneysmart.sg/property/short-term-rental-singapore/)*

There are many ways to start your search for placces. Here are a few I've found to be the better ones-
* **[Rent in Singapore](https://rentinsingapore.com.sg/)**
  * Pros:
    * Very good filters to narrow down your search
    * Many free to contact listings
  * Cons:
    * Do not trust the pictures all that much. I've seen same pictures used on multiple listings here
    * Agents flood the listings with same room or place under different listings. So finding genuine lisings can be tedious
* **[Property Guru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-for-rent)**
  * Havent used it much but I've been recommended this.
* **Facebook Groups** - best place to search, but apply to join as soon as possible as it takes time for admins to approve:
  * [Indian House & Room Rent Singapore](https://www.facebook.com/groups/139261379904754/)
  * [Flat & Flatmates in Singapore](https://www.facebook.com/groups/486211708130849/)
  * [Flat and Flatmates in Singapore](https://www.facebook.com/groups/352057701671476/)
  * [Property / Rooms For Rent / Sale - Singapore](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LuxuryRoom/)
  * [Room Rental in Singapore (No Agent Fee)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/341881149526889/)

Things to keep in mind about renting and properties:
* Always discuss with the owner/agent about **extra fees** upfront and checkout the property before closing the deal. There are 3 main models here:
  * Owner hires agent to search for tenant- Generally owner pays the agent fees
  * You can also go to agents to ask to see rooms/properties- You might be charged fees here
  * Owners/current renters post the listing and no agent is involved- go with this only if you understand what you're doing and generally preferred only if you're looking to rent a room instead of the full property.
* Also keep in mind that based on your permit, you'll have to choose a **[valid residential address](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing)**. For me, I can not live in Hostels here due to being an EP holder. HDBs and Condos should be good in most cases.
* Get your rental agreement **e-stamped**. It is required to do this within 15 days and can easily be done online. It is required for legitimacy - **[IRAS - Renting a Property](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Property/Working-out-your-Stamp-Duty/Renting-a-Property/)**
* **Private residences cannot be rented out for less than 3 months**. This is important as it means no AirBnB or similar models. You can live in Hotels(expensive) short term, but not in  residences. Ref: **[URA - Renting property](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Renting-Property)**

**Types of properties** you can rent (***[MOM rules](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing)***):
* **HDB**: Government housing, cheaper than condos, no extra amneities like gym/pool etc, Min legal contract is 6 months. Needs registration to HDB that you're living there.
* **Condo**: Private Societies, generally costly, have facilities like gym/pool/sports etc. Min legal contract is 3 months.
* **Standalone houses**: They are not part of a society. So no society benefits, but more private I guess.


## Transportation Guide

One of the best things about singapore is how good the public transport system is. Maybe I'm biased with only India as the other example, but this is a system where I can really ditch private vehicles and not feel like I'm losing out. Still, there are some things I can tell you beforehand that can help you get settled more easily. Check out official **[LTA website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around.html)** if you're up for it.

* It's all connected - The MRTs(Metro trains) and Buses are part of a **single transportation network**. They both accept same payment methods, and if you switch from one to another, it's considered part of the same *journey* when you're getting charged.
* In buses, there's a concept of **exit button**. Revolutionary, I know, but you have to know to avoid standing at the exit gate with the bus just breezing past your stop. Basically, press the exit button if you want to deboard at the next stop only if no one has pressed it before you for that stop.
* There's some apps with **real time location data** of which Bus/MRT is where allowing you to see exactly where the next bus is, thus making the journey/waiting much easier.
* **[Plan your Journey - LTA](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around/public_transport/plan_your_journey.html#travel_smart_by_planning_your_journey)** - There are rules to help you save money by planning better like you can make upto 5 transfers in a journey with upto 45 mins between each transfer that will help you avoid paying additional boarding charges multiple times in a journey. Good to check them out once.

Payment Methods-
* Cash - prices are higher if you're paying via cash, so don't.
* To begin with, you can get an **[EZ-link card](https://www.ezlink.com.sg/)** very easily from the airport. It's upto you if you want to keep it in the long run, as later on you'll be able to use more accessible payment methods. I won't recommend using this card in the long run as ezlink is only used for transportation and it doesn't make sense to keep another card when majority of the bank cards are also supported for these payments.
* You can also link your **Singapore cards** with **Google/Apple/Samsung pay** and use them for payment. You'll have to register for **[SimplyGo - TransitLink](https://simplygo.transitlink.com.sg/)** and add your card there. This also allows you to use the card directly if you don't want to use mobile for payments.
* **[NETS](https://www.nets.com.sg/personal/transit-payments/)** - NETS is something you'll see being supported everywhere in Singapore.

Useful Apps-
* [LTA Official - MyTransport.SG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.lta.mytransportsg)
* [SG BusLeh](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=originally.us.buses&hl=en)
* [Google Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en)

### Shopping
* **[Shopee](https://shopee.sg/)** / **[Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg)** / **[Qoo10](https://www.qoo10.sg)** - A bit unstructured, but really popular locally. Can give them a try as they generally have sales going on all the time.
* **[Amazon](https://www.amazon.sg/)** - New in Singapore, and collectoin is not that good. But if you want stuff from US, one of the best places to get it now with free shipping, Prime and everything.
* **[IMM Outlet Mall](https://www.capitaland.com/sg/malls/imm/en.html)]** - If you want to go to a factory outlet, this is the mall to visit
* **[Mustafa](https://www.mustafa.com.sg/)** - So big it's a tourist destination. Good place to find everything, especially imported Indian things.


### Things you'll need initially
* Cash - for deposit, rent, transport, initial shopping. You can also use multi currency cards to take it out, or the forex cards. But cash is required initially and is mainly used to pay in the food courts.
* Local prepaid SIM with Internet pack(get for ~2 weeks) - Do not give out the number in many places and get postpaid as soon as possible. Also remember to switch numbers everywhere you've given the initial one. This is required for EP, Bank account etc.
* An umbrella - It rains here.
