  <h1>Hi,</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Rahul, a full-stack engineer and web enthusiast living in Hyderabad, India.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Currently I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I'm working in the Seller space for Amazon Home Services, working full stack with focus on backend service oriented architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here I have worked on
    creating a full stack data processing tool,
    redesigning a management tool into a complex Single Page Application,
    reviewing and improving the security in applications,
    product launches in multiple marketplaces like Refunds and Reviews,
    improving the codebase and development practices.
    I have also worked on AWS platform to leverage it for end-to-end applications
    and micro services to break complex software into manageable well-defined chunks.

    Before Amazon, I've worked at Shopclues. Here I've worked on improving their application infrastructure in backend, creating web applications, and providing devops assistance by creating docker environments and web tools. I've also worked on consolidating the core communication module, and making it asynchronous by implementing queuing system which can manage millions of messages.
