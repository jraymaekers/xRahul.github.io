As you start earning in Singapore, you'll have to start looking into different methods of sending money from Singapore to India, be it for personal expenses, loans, family etc. To make the choice easier, here's what I've found between different remittance methods. The methods I am reviewing here are [DBS Bank Overseas Money Transfer](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/default.page), [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/invite/u/rahulj248) and [InstaReM](https://www.instarem.com/invite/cj5NBN).

## [DBS Bank Overseas Money Transfer](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/onboarding.page)

This is the easiest method to send money that I've found. You need to get a DBS account for this, and then you can use the default overseas transfer option given by them. You can find the options as below:

## [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/invite/u/rahulj248)

> A cheaper, faster way to send money abroad.

They are pretty famous for borderless account services(30+ countries) with multi-currency card(40+ currencies) that can send as well as receive money in different currencies. To transfer money overseas, find the options below:

2. Best conversion rates provided.
3. Transfer in an hour

Cons:
1. No direct bank to bank transfer. Money goes to Transferwise and comes from their bank accounts. So need to keep additional receipts for proof.
2. Transfer fees are highest among all 3 (0.59%)

## [InstaReM](https://www.instarem.com/invite/cj5NBN)

> Overseas Money Transfers  with Zero FX<super>*</super>

This is a Singapore-headquartered offering digital cross-border money transfers. While it has operations in multiple countries, it is not as famous as Transferwise. Give it a go as it currently provides the best overseas money transfer conversion amount. To transfer money overseas, find the options below:

## Conclusion

All 3 mentioned above are viable options, but for me, I've found InstaReM to give a little more than the rest. Transferwise might be good if you're in a hurry as the difference is not that much, but DBS gives around 1% lower converted currency than the rest, at least when I checked the prices here.

I would recommend getting an account with [DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/default.page), [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/invite/u/rahulj248) and [InstaReM](https://www.instarem.com/invite/cj5NBN), and then compare and transfer based on your preference and real-time comparison. All 3 methods offer additional benefits and features that will be useful in your long stay in Singapore!
